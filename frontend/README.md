# PETSHARK! Frontend
ReactJS app with custom configuration.

### Project structure
- `/public` - stores html template page where React app is rendered. Non-react imports can be added here directly, i.e. *favicon.ico* goes here
- `/src` - stores all files that make up the React app
    - `/src/index.js - the entrypoint of the app
    - `/src/pages` - stores website pages
    - `/src/components` - stores elements that are used by multiple pages
    - `/src/scss` - stores scss files for every element and page
    - `/src/assets` - stores static files, i.e. images, that will be served together with the frontend
- `/build` - stores the static website genreated by React for production

### Features
- Bootstrap (utility classes)
- Route configuration with 'react-router-dom'
- Fontawesome icons library
